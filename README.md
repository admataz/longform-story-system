# longform story system

a work in progress using [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) and [Svelte (v3)](https://svelte.dev) to deliver long form scrollable content 

## To get started with development: 
- check out this repos and `cd` to the project 
- run `npm install`
- change your `.env` file to reflect the location of your content csv file
- run `npm run dev`
- refer to the [sapper documentation](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for more advanced stuff and builds, etc

## the content csv
- see the structure in the [`sample-data.csv`](./static/sample-data.csv) file
- paths to media assets can be local URLs (`static/` is the web root) or absolute URLs to a CDN or something
